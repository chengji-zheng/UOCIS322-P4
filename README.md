<br/><br/>
This project is the first one of the series that builds a brevets web APP. In this section, it builds a website that allows the user to choose a date time when the brevets begins (starts calculate the time). Then the backend calculates the starts time and close time between the controls (with distences given by the user) and then pass the calculated time back to the frontend.
